"""
This file is dedicated to the practical session.
Functions and routines have to be completed, according to the subject provided by
 the standing guys.

By default, useful functions defined in local library (libtp) are imported,
 as many __future__ features that allows user to code in Python 3 style,
 even if the Pydinosaur is used.
 For all functions of libtp, don't hesitate to use the help() function for
 get the documentation about it.
  example: help(RkNN)
Moreover, example functions are defined. Maybe one of them will help you.

If the subject or the standing guys are not clear enough, please take a look
 to the following webpages, instead of throw rocks on them:
    - http://python-igraph.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html
    - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/igraph
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality
